I walked out the door and saw my childhood friend standing there, waiting for me to go to school with her.
Recchan, as I called her, was a square. She was light blue in colour and wore the high school uniform of our school.

As she waved to me, I breathed in to smell the ripe Spring air. She was motioning me to walk with her to our first day of high school.
Upon reaching her, I decided on a greeting to her.

1) Hey Recchan, you look really good in that school uniform! 
2) I don't really want to be seen walking together with you. I want a fresh start to our school.
