  storyText: "I walked out the door and saw my childhood friend standing there, waiting
    for me to go to school with her.\r\nRecchan, as I called her, was a square. She
    was light blue in colour and wore the high school uniform of our school.\r\n\r\nI
    breathed in to smell the ripe Spring air. She was motioning me to walk with her
    to our first day of high school.\r\nUpon reaching her, I decided on a greeting
    to her.\r\n\r\n1) Hey Recchan, you look really good in that school uniform! \rI'm
    glad to be going to the same school with you again.\n2) I don't really want to
    be seen walking together with you. I want a fresh start in high school."
